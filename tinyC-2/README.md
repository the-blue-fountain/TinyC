This project is a part of the Compilers Laboratory (CS39003) course at the Computer Science and Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur. The goal is to build a parser for tinyC, a subset of the C language, based on its phase structure grammar as specified by ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (E).

The assignment involves defining the lexical and syntactic specifications of tinyC using Flex and Bison. The parser outputs a human-readable parse tree for a given input program.
